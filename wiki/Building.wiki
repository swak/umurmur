#summary Building uMurmur

= Introduction =
uMurmur should be able to be built on any remotely POSIX-compliant platform, but the instructions mainly deals with how to build it for OpenWRT. If you want to build it for another platform only the files in the 'src' subdirectory is relevant. On a system with OpenSSL and libconfig development packages installed a simple 'make' in this directory should do the trick.

= Build for OpenWRT =
To build for OpenWRT you need a Linux/Unix-like host. Cygwin under Windows is not supported. Use a linux dist image with VMWare or some other virtual machine if you don't have a spare Linux build server (but everyone has one, don't they ;)

To do this, download the source, unpack it and run 
{{{
# make menuconfig
}}}
Then in the menu, select your target platform and model and also select to build the SDK. Exit the menu and run
{{{
# make
}}}
The SDK should end up in subdir bin/. Extract it somewhere on your disk, e.g.:
{{{
# tar xfj OpenWrt-SDK-brcm47xx-for-Linux-x86_64-gcc-4.1.2_uClibc-0.9.30.1.tar.bz2
}}}
and then cd to the 'package' subdirectory of the SDK directory:
{{{
# cd OpenWrt-SDK-brcm47xx-for-Linux-x86_64-gcc-4.1.2_uClibc-0.9.30.1/package
}}}
Use Subversion to fetch the uMurmur sources:
{{{
# svn export https://umurmur.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ umurmur
}}}
the 'cd ..' back to the SDK base directory and start the build:
{{{
# cd ..
# make
}}}
And finally, the package should be waiting in the 'bin/packages/target/' subdir.

#summary Building uMurmur

= Introduction =
uMurmur should be able to be built on any remotely POSIX-compliant platform. 

== General build instruction==
To build with OpenSSL:
Make sure you have OpenSSL and development packages installed. Enter the 'src' subdirectory and issue a 'make'. If any package is installed in a nonstandard place you need to edit the Makefile.

To build with PolarSSL:
Edit the Makefile to reflect the location of PolarSSL and uncomment the PolarSSL-relevant lines. Comment the OpenSSL-relevant lines. libconfig development package need to be installed. Issue 'make'.

= Build for OpenWRT =
To build for OpenWRT you need a Linux/Unix-like host. Cygwin under Windows is not supported. Use a linux dist image with VMWare or some other virtual machine if you don't have a spare Linux build server (but everyone has one, don't they ;)

Build or otherwise get hold of an OpenWRT SDK for the target platform and version. Use Subversion to fetch the uMurmur sources or download it from the project page and extract it to the packages subdir.

...etc.

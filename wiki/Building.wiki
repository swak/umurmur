#summary Building uMurmur

= Introduction =
uMurmur should be able to be built on any remotely POSIX-compliant platform, but the instructions mainly deals with how to build it for OpenWRT. You need a Linux/Unix-like host to do this. Cygwin under windows is not supported. Use a linux dist image with VMWare or some other virtual machine if you don't have a spare Linux build server (but everyone has one, don't they ;)

= Build the SDK =
Build the OpenWRT SDK for your platform. To do this, download the source, unpack it and run 
{{{
# make menuconfig
}}}
Then in the menu, select your target platform and model and also select to build the SDK. Exit the menu and run
{{{
# make
}}}
The SDK should end up in subdir bin/. Extract it somewhere on your disk, e.g.:
{{{
# tar xfj OpenWrt-SDK-brcm47xx-for-Linux-x86_64-gcc-4.1.2_uClibc-0.9.30.1.tar.bz2
}}}
and then cd to the 'package' subdirectory of the SDK directory:
{{{
# cd OpenWrt-SDK-brcm47xx-for-Linux-x86_64-gcc-4.1.2_uClibc-0.9.30.1/package
}}}
Use Subversion to fetch the uMurmur sources:
{{{
# svn export https://umurmur.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ umurmur
}}}
the 'cd ..' back to the SDK base directory and start the build:
{{{
# cd ..
# make
}}}
And finally, the package should be waiting in the 'bin/packages/target/' subdir.

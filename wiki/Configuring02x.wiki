#summary Configuring version 0.2.x

= Example configuration =

_Note:_
  # The `max_bandwidth` parameter unit is *bits/second* (changed from 0.1.x) per user.
  # The Root channel bust be defined first in the channel list.
  # The child channels _must_ have their parent channel defined before in the list.

Example configuration file:

{{{
max_bandwidth = 48000;
welcometext = "Welcome to uMurmur!";
certificate = "/etc/umurmur/cert.crt";
private_key = "/etc/umurmur/key.key";
password = "";
max_users = 10;

# Specify port and/or address to bind to. Typically not needed.
# Default is '*' for address and 64738 for port. 
# Can also be specified on the command line, which takes precedence if
# both are specified.
# bindport = 64738;
# bindaddr = "192.168.1.1";

# Specify this for privilege dropping. If username is specified but not 
# the groupname, the user's login group is used.
# username = "umurmuruser";
# groupname = "umurmurgrp";

# Root channel must always be defined first.
# If a channel has a parent, the parent must be defined before the child channel(s).
channels = ( {
	 name = "Root";
	 parent = "";
	 description = "The Root of all channels";
	 noenter = true;

	 {

== General configuration parameters ==
Many parameters are optional and have default values. 

Optional parameters with defaults within parenthesis:
  * `max_bandwidth` (48000)
  * `welcometext` ("Welcome to uMurmur!")
  * `certificate` ("/etc/umurmur/certificate.crt")
  * `private_key` ("/etc/umurmur/private_key.key")
  * `password` ("" = empty)
  * `max_users` (10)
  * `default_channel` (root channel)
  * `bindaddr` (INADDR_ANY)
  * `bindport` (64738)

== Channels configuration ==
In the channel configuration `name` and `parent` are required. The `noenter`, `password` and `description` parameters are optional where `noenter` defaults to `false`, `description` and `password` to "".

The noenter parameter controls whether a channel can be entered or not. This can be useful when grouping channels together in a 'folder', e.g. a game name.

Summary of channel parameters:
  * `name` (required)
  * `parent` (required)
  * `noenter` (optional)
  * `password` (optional)
  * `description` (optional)

== Channel links configuration ==
Channel links is a one-way duplication of speech from one channel to another when whispering to the channel. It is not neccesary to configure this unless you need it. An example usage, as demonstrated in the example configuration above, is to make all speech whispered to the lobby also be directed to the team channels. The speech in the team channels is *not* directed to the lobby.

In `channel_links`, both `source` and `destination` parameter are required.

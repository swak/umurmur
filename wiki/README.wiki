====================================
Project page on [GoogleCode](http://code.google.com/p/umurmur/)

uMurmur is a minimalistic Mumble server primarily targeted to run on embedded computers, like routers, with an open OS like OpenWRT. The server part of Mumble is called Murmur, hence the name uMurmur. It is available as a precompiled package for quite a lot distributions. Check your distribution's package repository.

Instructions for building from source
-------------------------------------
1. Requirements
	* [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) or [PolarSSL](http://polarssl.org/) library
	* [libconfig](http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/)
	* [libprotoc-c](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-c/) version 0.14 or 0.15 (use --disable-protoc option in its ./configure to build only the library). If you for some reason have to run an earlier version you need to recompile the protocol file `Mumble.proto` using the protobuf compiler for the corresponding version.

2. Build
	* `./configure`
	* `make`

3. Install
	* `make install`
	* Edit umurmur.conf.example to your liking and put it in a suitable place. /etc/umurmur.conf is default.

4. Run `umurmurd -c <conf file> -p <PID file> -r`. For other switches and their meaning run `umurmurd -h`

A startup script can easily be created if you want to. Just copy an existing script and edit it to your liking.
